Your GitHub public activity feed.

Simply configure and add `{% raw %}{{ PicoGitHubActivity.rendered }}{% endraw %}` to your template to have your GitHub public activity feed display on your Pico site.

This variable comes already styled, scripted, and ready to go, however, you can also break it out into its CSS, HTML, and JS for added customizability.
